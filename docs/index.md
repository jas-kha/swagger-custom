This project supports customizing Swagger UI using the **swagger-custom** package. Developers can choose between two integration approaches based on how their Swagger documentation is structured:

* If your API docs are stored in **swagger.json**, use **Method 1**.
* If your API docs are generated or structured as **JavaScript modules**, use **Method 2**.

Both methods provide full support for custom CSS, JS, and UI themes.
